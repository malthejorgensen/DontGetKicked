# DontGetKicked
This is a project for the Kaggle competition [Don't Get Kicked!](http://www.kaggle.com/c/DontGetKicked).

The project uses:
* [Python](python.org) (tested with 2.6)
* [numpy](http://numpy.org/) (tested with 1.6.1)
* [FANN](http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/) (2.1.0)
* [argparse](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse) (tested with 1.1)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net) (tested with 1.0.1)
	* only needed for: `zipcodes.py`, `states.py`


The project currently consists of the following files:
* `load.py` -- the main file. Loads the training data and transforms it into training data for FANN.
* `zipcodes.py` -- Plots the _IsBadBuy_ score for each zipcode.
* `states.py` -- Plots the _IsBadBuy_ score for each state.
